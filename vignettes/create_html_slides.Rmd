## Template

The **`unhcrdown::html_slides` ** template is using the [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1) package for **creating UNHCR branded HTML presentations** with [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/#1) through R Markdown.

To create a UNHCR branded HTML presentation just create a new R Markdown document with the YAML section, as shown below:

```yaml
---
title: "Main presentation title"
subtitle: "Subtitle if needed"
author: "Your name"
institute: "Bureau/Divisions"
date: "`r format(Sys.Date(),  '%d %B %Y')`"
output:
  unhcrdown::html_slides:
    self_contained: true
    nature:
      highlightStyle: github
      highlightLines: true
      countIncrementalSlides: false
      ratio: "16:9"
---
```

or just open the template provided if you are using RStudio IDE (see [README](https://github.com/vidonne/unhcrdown)).

Click the `Knit` button to compile it and you get the title slide of your presentation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/html_slides_title.png")
```

### YAML

Not all the `unhcrdown::html_slides` YAML arguments are mandatory, for example include only the `title` if sufficient for your presentation. All the arguments, coming after the `unhcrdown::html_slides` call, are part of the **xaringan** package. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for all possible configurations. The template skeleton or above YAML example is using the recommended setup.

### Navigate

Press **h** or **?** to see the `remark.js` [keyboard shortcuts](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan-key.html), to help you navigate your presentation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/revealjs_help.png")
```

Common presenting workflow, if you have two screens:

- Press **c** to clone your presentation
- **On the presentation screen:** Move cloned window here, then press **f** for full-screen mode
- **On the extra screen:** Press **p** for presenter mode. See below on how to add [presenter notes](#presenter)

## Basic slides

Beside the title slide, the default style is top-left aligned content on a white background. The template includes some helper classes to override the default and create custom looking slides, such as section break.

### Usage

- Slide content starts immediately after the YAML ends
- Use 3 dashes in a row `---` on a line by itself to create a new slide
- Use 2 dashes in a row `--` for incremental content
- <span id="presenter">Presenter notes can be created using `???`</span>

```
---
title: "Main presentation title"
output:unhcrdown::html_slides
---

# Slide one

* First bullet

--

* Second bullet

-- 
  
* Third bullet

???
Notes on slide 1

---

# Slide Two

Lorem ispum...

```

### Alignement

Use the following classes to align content within a slide:

* **Vertical alignment:** `left`, `middle`, `right`
* **Horizontal alignment:** `top`, `center`, `bottom`

The alignment classes can be applied to the whole slide or some specific content within it. A mix of vertical and horizontal alignment can be use to affect the position of the whole slide content, by default the content is `top-left` aligned. 
```
---
class: middle, center

# Middle-center
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/html_slides_alignment.png")
```

The horizontal alignment classes **only** can also be used to move specific content within the overall slide alignment.

```
---
class: middle, center

# Middle-center

.left[This text will appear on the **left side** of the slide]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/html_slides_alignment_left.png")
```


### Layout

You can place content to the left or right using the following classes `.pull-left[]` and `.pull-right[]`. This will create a two-columns layout, where each column take up to 47% of the page width. All the column content needs to go within the respective `[]`. You can similarly use `.left-column[]` and `.right-column[]`, the sizes are then 20% and 75%.

```
# Two columns

Each column takes 47% of the total width

.pull-left[Lorem ipsum...]

.pull-right[Lorem ipsum...]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/html_slides_twocolumns.png")
```

The layout classes are really helpful and can create complex layout by nesting them:

```
---
# Columns within columns

.pull-left[
.pull-left[
### Col 1.1
This is a `.pull-left[]` within a `.pull-left[]`
]
.pull-right[
### Col 1.2
This is a `.pull-right[]` within a `.pull-left[]`
]
]

.pull-right[
.pull-left[
### Col 2.1
This is a `.pull-left[]` within a `.pull-right[]`
]
.pull-right[
### Col 2.2
This is a `.pull-right[]` within a `.pull-right[]`
]
]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/html_slides_multiplecolumns.png")
```

### UNHCR helpers

To further ease the creation of UNHCR branded presentation some specific classes have been added to stylize even more the content of a slide. The font family and styles are already set to fit within the brand but in some cases you might need more flexibility.

Some classes allow to alter the text size, colour and background:

* **Text size:** `.large[]` and `.small[]`
* **Text colour:** `.blue[]` and `.grey[]`
* **Text background colour:** `.bg-blue[]` and `.bg-grey[]`

```
---
# UNHCR Helpers

You can change the **size** of the text by using the `.large[]` or `.small[]` class

.large[Large text] followed by .small[small text] example

You can change the **colour** of the text by using the `.blue[]` or `.grey[]` class

.blue[Blue text] followed by .grey[grey text] example

You can change the **background** of the text by using the `.bg-blue[]` or `.bg-grey[]` class

.bg-blue[All this text will be in a blue background]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/html_slides_unhcrhelpers.png")
```

### Images and icons

Depending of your needs and control over the image output you can use the following approaches to include images in your slides:

* Inline R Markdown: `![](path_to_image)`
* [Knitr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.30/topics/include_graphics): `knitr::include_graphics("path_to_image")`
* Plain [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp): `<img src="path_to_image" width="90%"/>`

The brand unit recommend the use of the [Humanitarian icons](https://brand.unocha.org/d/xEPytAUjC3sH/icons) which are now part of the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/categories/humanitarian) set. We recommend the use of the [`fontawesome`](https://rstudio.github.io/fontawesome/) R package, simply install and load the package to access directly the whole Fontawesome set:

* r fa("hands-holding-circle", fill = "var(--unhcr-blue)") = `r fa("hands-holding-circle", fill = "#0072bc")`

### Background

**Colour:**

The default slide background is white but you can apply a branded UNHCR blue by adding the class `inverse` to the slide. This can be useful to create section break in your presentation. The `inverse` class can be coupled with the alignment classes.

```
---
class: inverse

# Blue background slide
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/html_slides_inverse.png")
```


**Image:**

* You can specify a background image (or multiple images) at the start of your slide just like you did the class for the background colour:

```
---
background-image: url(path_to_image)
background-size: cover
background-position: center
```

* Options for `background-size` include:

   * `cover` will cover the slide so that there is no white space (may cut tops/sides)
   * `contain` fits to slide height-wise
   
* See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp) on how you can play around with background position.

* Play with the `inverse` class of the slide depending on the logo colour that works better with your picture. If needed, you can remove the logo altogether by putting the `hide-logo` class.

```
---
class: hide-logo
background-image: url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vidonne/unhcrdown/master/inst/resources/img/cover-example.jpg)
background-size: cover
background-position: center 25%
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/html_slides_bgimage.png")
```


## R content

Because **`unhcrdown::html_slides`** is an R Markdown document you can natively include R code chunks but also tables and plots.
